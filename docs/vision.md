# Vision

Basically what I want to do with this, why I am writing this.

In the end *this* will be a static site generator based on Markdwon documents. I personally want to sue this for a few things:

- my blog
- a single page site (not int he app sense but scroll down instead of sub-pages)
- a normal website without blog content
- my personal website

Each of these come with different challenges and requirements.

- **blog** Need to handle a lot of entries. They need to be categorised. Not only they need to be rendered, but pages for all tags, all categories and overviews.
- **Single Page** Would be totally cool to compose this out of multiple documents instead of writing one really long one.
- **Website** Just parse each file into a site following a design.
- **Personal site** A lot of linking between sites as I want this in GER and ENG.

## Motivation

Now, why build my own system when there is hexo and stuff out there?

Well I like to build stuff myself :)  
And I feel like there could be a better support for rendering engines. For example I really want something react based. I looked deeper into multiple systems but didn't 100% like any of them. So here goes my own one.

## Some goals

Really random thoughts:
- Make sure we can easily switch rendering engine

# Name

Children need a name, lets call this one '我报' (wǒ bào, eng.: I reported).
