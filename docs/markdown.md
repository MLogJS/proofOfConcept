# Markdown support

Criteria for a Markdown to HTML converter:
- in JS
- extensible

Looked at:
- https://github.com/chjj/marked
- https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js
- https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown
- https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it

Decided to go with Markedown-it. Stumbled upon it as a suggestion in the Atom repo. The demo is pretty cool. Creating extensions looks more complicated though more powerfull than creating extensions for showdown. Markdown-js and marked failed on the extensible part.
